# GraphQL

- REST-ful, routing, may need lots of diff http requests, expensive, may over fetch data

- a graph is a data structure that contains notes which are symbolised by all the rectangles and nodes, referred to as edges.

- once we have organised our data into a graph, we can query it with graphql.

## Getting started

- datastore, Express/GraphQL server, GraphiQL (pre built app)
- express is responsible for handling incoming http requests and making responses to be sent back
